# Java-CPU
Computer that can read and execute instructions to perform basic mathematical operations. Written iteratively as part of the ICSI 404 (Assembly Computer Organization) coursework
The project includes three test files ("cpu_test1.java", "cpu_test2.java", "cpu_test3.java")
that were used to test the driver program "cpu.java" during development. 

The test programs feed the CPU basic instructions to push or pop values from the register and use those values to perform mathematical operations,
the results of which can be pushed to a register or saved in the memory.
